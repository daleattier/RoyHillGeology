The latest version of QGIS has been released and, unusually, there is a bit of excitement around about this one. I think the feature most of us are eager to see is the 3D Map implementation. I would also suggest checking out some of the links below to see some of the other features, I have included one at the end which will save me lots of time.

One of my favourite though technical overviews is from Anita Graser’s blog.

Another one is Kurt Menke:

While the final version hasn’t been released, the nightly development build has the new 3D Map functionality which we should see in the new release. I thought it would be good to quickly run through the new features:

After opening QGIS go to the View menu and select New 3D Map View.

In the new pop up view click on the configuration menu to set the 3D surface your map will display on. The rest of the options allow us to tweak the quality, the most import one is the vertical scale.

Below are some screenshots of the Roy Hill 250k Geological map, first as a normal 2D map and then as a 3D Map.

Finally, as promised one of my favourite new features is in the Coordinate reference screen. The screenshot below shows the current view (purple cross) and how it sits within the Zone. I know this will save me a lot of time.

If you would like to try this yourself once the new version is available, I have a link to my dataset and project below.
